Agon is an application for organizing swiss tournaments, especially Magic - The Gathering Events.

The name Agon is a short form of Agonothetai, which was the original name of the game organizers for the olympic games. (Their name was changed to Hellanodikai, but that doesn't sound good for an app name.)

The app was designed to fit the needs of the WÃ¼rzburger 'Fantasy and Boardgame Club'.
